# KeepFit

Installation instructions:

1. Please install the latest version of Xcode, preferably on a Mac running the latest MacOS (Big Sur 11.2.3).
2. Download the .zip file (KeepFit-NetworkChanges.zip) from Blackboard, or clone the project from git (https://github.com/samiam713/KeepFit.git).
   Similarly, you can clone the project directly from Xcode.
3. Once you have downloaded the zip file, unzip it and open the project folder (KeepFit-NetworkChanges) in Xcode.
4. When the project has loaded, select the iPhone 12 simulator (version 14.3 or later).
5. At this point, ensure that our team has started the server, otherwise the functionality within the app will not work.
6. Select 'Build and Run' from the Xcode interface.

Additional Notes:

SportsApp.zip includes files for the backend, which should not be needed to run the KeepFit application. The files are simply provided as a backup in case you want to see the work we have completed for that portion.

If you have questions, please email any members of the team!
